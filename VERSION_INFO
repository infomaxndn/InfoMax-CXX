V 0.3.1
* Disabled share_ptr<Data> in InfoMaxProducer (segmentation fault); thus segmentation fault when multiple requests occur is fixed.
* InfoMaxProducerSimulator and InfoMaxConsumerSimulator are created
* TrivialProducerSimulator and TrivialConsumerSimulator are created
* Only leaf nodes can have data (see addChild function in InfoMaxProducer)
* Added getPrefix() in InfoMaxProducer
* Fixed minor bug in InfoMaxProducer which makes seg fault when prefix has more than 1 name component.
** Remaining:
*** Send wiredName array instead of strings as infomax list.
*** Simple algorithm does not function correctly.
*** Receivers only receive last name list when getting cached data.

V 0.3
* Adds Tweak sort binary insert.
* Consumer timeout issue is fixed.
* When a node is inserted into the tree, the node is also added to prioritizedVector for Tweak sory algorithm.
* Has "Chicago Crime" example
** Remaining:
*** Send wiredName array instead of strings as infomax list.
*** With multiple requests from a consumer, a producer makes a segmentation fault error.
*** Simple algorithm does not function correctly.

V 0.2
* Has tweak sort algorithm without binary insert.
** Remaining:
*** Fix Consumer timeout issue.
*** Add binary insert functionality.
*** Send wiredName array instead of strings as infomax list.

V 0.1
* Uses string to send the list fo items to ask for.
* The consumer timesout when asking for a particular element.
* Only has simple priority algorithm implemented.
